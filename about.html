        A blend of eastern and western influences, Thai food harmonizes the dietary preferences of many cultures into a synthesis that blends sweet, sour, spicy, and bitter flavors to create a unique dining experience. 
        Thai cuisine boasts some of the most popular dishes in the world, but as delicious as they are the story of their origins is just as fascinating. Today let us delve into this history and see how some of your favorite Thai recipes came to be.

        <p>
        <b>The Roots of Traditional Thai Cuisine</b><br>
        Thai cuisine may be as much as 1,400 years old, as this is the period when the region we call Thailand began to be heavily settled by a mass migration of people from regions of modern China. 
        Historically these people dined on plants, herbs, and aquatic creatures. Meat other than seafood was difficult to come by because large domestic animals were too valuable to slaughter. 
        Thus, meat was often used sparingly for flavor like western cultures would use seasoning, with a small amount going a long way in a Thai recipe. The favored methods of food preparation in this traditional Thai cuisine included stewing, baking, and grilling. 
        As time went by, stir-frying and deep-frying also became popular. It was in this period when fried rice (Khao pad) and noodles (pad thai) became staples of the Thai diet.

        <b>How Thai Cuisine Changed with the Times</b><br>  
        While original Thai cuisine had much in common with dietary practices of the Szechuan province of China, perhaps the first influence that changed Thai cooking was their neighbors on the subcontinent. 
        Curries that included ghee from India became very popular, but the Thai people altered the recipes to use native ingredients such as coconut instead. After the European discovery of the Americas, the Portuguese brought chili spices to the region, 
        and these became a component of the famously spicy dishes that remain immensely popular to this day. It was at this time that regional preferences became more distinct, with five or so regions developing unique dishes that varied due to the agricultural diversity of the region.
